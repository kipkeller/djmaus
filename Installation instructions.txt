djmaus installation notes

Should work on mac, linux, windows.

1. Install matlab.
2. Install psych toolbox. Download from www.psychtoolbox.org 
3. Download djmaus from https://github.com/wehr-lab/djmaus and put anywhere. Add that folder to matlab path.
	-Pro tip: if you expect to do any code development, clone it instead (using the github desktop or command-line). Then you can commit changes.
	-desktop: click "changes" tab at top, review which checked files you want to commit, 
		add summary (required) and details (optional), click "commit to master", and then click sync in upper right corner.

4. Install Open Ephys GUI. Download from http://www.open-ephys.org/gui/
	to use Network Events on Mac you need to build from source code, 
	which is described here: https://open-ephys.atlassian.net/wiki/display/OEW/Mac+OS+X 
5. Install zeroMQ. Download from http://zeromq.org/intro:get-the-software 
	Using package managers is much better:
	linux:
		sudo add-apt-repository ppa:chris-lea/zeromq
		sudo apt-get update
		sudo apt-get install libzmq3-dbg libzmq3-dev libzmq3
	mac: 
		install macports from www.macports.org/install.php
		relaunch your terminal
		sudo port install zmq3

6. If the zeroMQ mex file doesn’t work (check with matlab_zeroMQ_wrapper_example.m), you might need to compile the mex from source code. 
	Make sure g++ 4.7 is installed:
		linux:
			sudo apt-get install g++-4.7
			sudo ln -s /usr/bin/g++-4.7 /usr/bin/g++ 
		mac:
	Download the open-ephys source code from https://github.com/open-ephys/GUI
	Edit GUI/Resources/matlab/compile_matlab_wrapper.m to have the right paths to your OE install, and then run it. Test by running matlab_wrapper

That's it. 

More notes:
If launch the open-ephys GUI and network events source doesn't show, try this:
linux:
	sudo add-apt-repository ppa:chris-lea/zeromq
	sudo apt-get update
	sudo apt-get install libzmq3-dbg libzmq3-dev libzmq3
	(from https://open-ephys.atlassian.net/wiki/display/OEW/Linux)
mac: build open-ephys from source as described here: https://open-ephys.atlassian.net/wiki/display/OEW/Mac+OS+X 
Network Events documentation: https://open-ephys.atlassian.net/wiki/display/OEW/Network+Events 

the python network console might be helpful for development
it requires 
apt-get install python-zmq
